                    <p>The mission of the Lac Hong Vietnamese Language School is to preserve the Vietnamese heritage by educating students in Vietnamese language, culture, values, and history. The primary objectives of Lac Hong Vietnamese Language School are to ensure that each student will:<br />
                    <br />
                    Develop the ability to fluently speak, listen, read, and write Vietnamese.<br />
                    Develop the knowledge of Vietnamese history and culture.<br />
                    Become responsible citizen through sharing and volunteering work.<br />
                    <br />
                    It is our intent to provide a harmonic environment for students to build friendships and community responsibilities; thereby, keeping them “off-the-street.”</p>
